# Fractionate
InDesign / InCopy Script to make fractions

You'll need to set the character styles: "Fraction Upper", "Fraction Upper Last", "Fraction Slash" and "Fraction Lower", to be in a group called "Fractions".

"Fraction Upper" is for the upper numbers except the last which uses "Fraction Upper Last"

"Fraction Slash" styles the slash

"Fraction Lower" styles the lower numbers


To apply, type out a fraction like 11/11 and select it, then run the script. It ignores spaces at either end.
